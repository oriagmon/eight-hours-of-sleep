# eight-hours-of-sleep
I wanted to challenge myself to develop my first android application in one hour.
I decided to take the challenge further and also expriment with Kotlin, a language I was not familiar with at all.

The outcome is useful, and is actually a practical solution which I'm using on a daily basis.
